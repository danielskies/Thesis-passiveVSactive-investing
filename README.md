# Thesis Project: Risk-Adjusted Performance of Actively Managed Funds vs. Passively Managed ETFs during Uncertain Times

# Introduction
This README presents the findings of my Bachelor's thesis project in International Business Administration, which aimed to investigate the hypothesis:

"During times of uncertainty, the risk-adjusted performance of actively managed funds will be closer to, or potentially exceed the risk-adjusted performance of passively managed ETFs, compared to performance differences observed in certain times."

To test this hypothesis, I employed regression analysis methods, including the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), Fama French 3-Factor Model, and Carhart Four-Factor Model. Additionally, I compared various risk-adjusted return measurements, such as the Sharpe ratio, Treynor ratio, Information ratio, and Jensen's alpha.

# Methodology
To assess the risk-adjusted performance of actively managed funds and passively managed ETFs during uncertain times, the following steps were undertaken:

Data Collection: Gathered historical financial data for the selected actively managed funds and passively managed ETFs. The data encompassed a specific time period marked by notable uncertainty.

Regression Analysis: Applied the CAPM, Fama French 3-Factor Model, and Carhart Four-Factor Model to estimate the risk-adjusted performance of the funds and ETFs.

Risk-Adjusted Return Measurements: Calculated and compared various risk-adjusted return measurements, including the Sharpe ratio, Treynor ratio, Information ratio, and Jensen's alpha. These metrics provided insights into the funds' performance relative to their level of risk.

# Findings
Based on the analysis conducted, the results indicate the following:

Risk-Adjusted Performance: During uncertain times, the risk-adjusted performance of actively managed funds tended to be closer to, or potentially exceed, the risk-adjusted performance of passively managed ETFs. This finding suggests that active management strategies may be more effective in navigating uncertain market conditions.

Regression Analysis: The regression analysis using the CAPM, Fama French 3-Factor Model, and Carhart Four-Factor Model provided robust measures of risk-adjusted performance, considering multiple factors that influence fund returns.

Risk-Adjusted Return Measurements: The comparison of risk-adjusted return measurements, such as the Sharpe ratio, Treynor ratio, Information ratio, and Jensen's alpha, supported the hypothesis by demonstrating that actively managed funds exhibited competitive risk-adjusted performance during uncertain periods.

# Conclusion
In conclusion, this thesis project examined the risk-adjusted performance of actively managed funds and passively managed ETFs during uncertain times. The findings suggest that actively managed funds may offer a closer or potentially superior risk-adjusted performance compared to passively managed ETFs in such circumstances.

The regression analysis methods, including the CAPM, Fama French 3-Factor Model, and Carhart Four-Factor Model, along with various risk-adjusted return measurements, provided comprehensive insights into the performance of the funds.

It is important to note that these findings are based on the specific time period and dataset used in this study. Further research and analysis should be conducted to validate the results and consider additional factors that may impact the performance of actively managed funds and passively managed ETFs in times of uncertainty.
